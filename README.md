### ✅ Improvements Made:
- Headings now use proper `#` markdown (so GitHub renders them bigger & bolder).
- Directory tree inside **fenced code block** → perfect alignment.
- **Environment variables** are in a clean table format.
- Added section dividers `---` for clear separation.
- Demo video link now stays centered with a clean thumbnail style.
- Kept all your emojis, but now inside structured headings for readability.

If you use **this exact README.md** in your repo, it will look professional and perfectly aligned on GitHub.  

Do you also want me to **create a modern, clean `assets/demo-thumbnail.png`** so your Google Drive video link has a professional clickable preview instead of the broken image? That would make it look even better.
